ABSTRACT (Lisiecki and Raymo 2005):
  We present a 5.3-Myr stack (the "LR04" stack) of benthic d18O records
from 57 globally distributed sites aligned by an automated graphic
correlation algorithm. This is the first benthic d18O stack composed of more
than three records to extend beyond 850 ka, and we use its improved signal
quality to identify 24 new marine isotope stages in the early Pliocene.
We also present a new LR04 age model for the Pliocene-Pleistocene derived
from tuning the d18O stack to a simple ice model based on 21 June insolation
at 65N. Stacked sedimentation rates provide additional age model constraints
to prevent overtuning. Despite a conservative tuning strategy, the LR04 benthic
stack exhibits significant coherency with insolation in the obliquity band
throughout the entire 5.3 Myr and in the precession band for more than half
of the record. The LR04 stack contains significantly more variance in benthic
d18O than previously published stacks of the late Pleistocene as the result
of higher resolution records, a better alignment technique, and a greater
percentage of records from the Atlantic. Finally, the relative phases of the
stack’s 41- and 23-kyr components suggest that the precession component of
d18O from 2.7–1.6 Ma is primarily a deep-water temperature signal and that
the phase of d18O precession response changed suddenly at 1.6 Ma.

DESCRIPTION:
  Lisiecki-Raymo 2004 (LR04) Global Pliocene-Pleistocene Benthic D18O Stack.

The LR04 stack spans 5.3 Myr and was constructed by graphically aligning
57 globally distributed benthic d18O records. Its age model is orbitally tuned
to June 21 insolation at 65N but is also constrained by the average sedimentation
rates of the 57 sites.
